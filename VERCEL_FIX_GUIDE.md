# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## The Issue
Your build was failing because:
1. Replit-specific plugins in vite.config.ts
2. Incorrect Vercel configuration
3. Path resolution issues for production

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated vite.config.ts
- Removed Replit-specific plugins
- Fixed path resolution for Vercel
- Simplified build configuration

### 2. Updated vercel.json
- Corrected routing for API and static files
- Proper serverless function configuration
- Fixed output directory paths

### 3. Updated api/index.ts
- Standalone Express app for Vercel functions
- Proper CORS and middleware setup
- Direct route registration

## Deploy Steps

### Option 1: Push to GitHub & Auto-Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```
Vercel will automatically redeploy with the fixes.

### Option 2: Manual Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## What the Fix Does

1. **Removes Replit Dependencies**: No more `@replit/vite-plugin-*` imports
2. **Fixes File Paths**: Uses standard `__dirname` instead of `import.meta.dirname`
3. **Corrects Build Output**: Points to the right directories
4. **Simplifies API**: Standalone Express app for serverless functions

## Expected Result

After deployment, your portfolio will:
- Load properly at your Vercel URL
- Have working API endpoints
- Display all your GitHub projects
- Function contact form
- Responsive design intact

## If Issues Persist

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check that all files were uploaded to GitHub

Your portfolio should now deploy successfully on Vercel!
